Sriram Venkatakrishnan is the creator of StoryDharma — where ancient Indian wisdom meets modern mediums like AI, game design, and storytelling.

Combining analytical rigor with a storyteller’s soul, and backed by an MBA from the Asian Institute of Management (often called the Harvard of the East) and IIM Ahmedabad, Sriram brings decades of global leadership across strategy, marketing, and technology. He is currently learning Sanskrit to access India’s classical texts — from the Panchatantra to the Arthashastra — in their original form.

Through books, games, and digital experiments, he transforms timeless tales into practical playbooks for navigating the fast-changing world of work.

Read his work if you're ready to outsmart chaos, lead with character, and succeed the dharmic way.
