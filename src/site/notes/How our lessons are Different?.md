## How our lessons are different?

First, let us start from the source and its application. Typically, authors take a philosophical literature (Bhagavad Gita) or characters from Epics and interpret  them to corporate context. This book is different. The source is Panchatantra which is written with leadership and management in mind. And the lessons are not interpreted, they are given verbatim in the core text.

Second, the form of this content is not dry teaching. It is presented as a business story making it easy to read and remember.

Third, this is a multi-modal experience. We have an online assessment. You can read series in digital form,  tap or click on links to access AI Coaches to work with,  we have stories presented in Comic form, you will be asked to solve Dharmic puzzles online and then we have the 100+ nitis collection which are lessons in short poetry form with translation.

Fourth, just as the source , this book doesn’t shy away from stating the facts. The lessons in this book will fall under 4 buckets. 

> [!note]
> Some lessons, you will say ‘I know this’ already.
> 
> Some lessons, you will say ‘It might not work in my Organization’.
> 
> Some lessons, you will ask ‘Isn’t that unethical?’
> 
> Some lessons, you will say ‘Wow! That’s awesome’.


Be rest assured, all of them work. It will make you a successful, no not just successful, but a very dangerous and successful version of yourself without compromising on your conscience.
Now, let us start with the framing story of Mitra-Bhedha.
