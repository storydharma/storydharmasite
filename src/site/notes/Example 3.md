## Example 3

In another episode, the Jackal’s idea had gone into a zone where nobody knows what would happen. In short it had not thought about all the consequences of his ideas. There is another Jackal who is his friend and alter-ego who points out this mistake. In this context, Panchatantra offers a brilliant framework to think about execution of Ideas called ‘mantragati’ or in short 'The movement or flow of thought, plan, or discourse’.

> Panchavidho hi mantrah, sa ca
> Karmaṇām ārambha upāyaḥ.
> Puruṣadravyasampat
> Deśakālavibhāgaḥ
> Vinipāta Pratikāraḥ
> Kāryasiddhi


One has to think about these 5 aspects when one is executing something

> [!note]
> How to start the execution?
> Who are the People and Material required to execute?
> When and where should the work happen?
> What can go wrong? How to mitigate?
> Attainment of a goal (outcomes)


The Jackal points out **risk mitigation** or **Vinipāta Pratikāraḥ** as the flaw in the current plan to the other Jackal.  

Imagine this. This was written 2500 years ago. If you apply this even today, your endeavors will be successful.  I am equally humbled and proud to have been born in such a civilization which has such insight and also having this brought this book to fruition. Now, I am hoping you are convinced on the applicability of lessons from Panchatantra for today’s world.  

Before we jump into actual lessons,  we have to cover a little bit of ground on introducing the Panchatantra, how this series is organized and structured for you to get the maximum benefit from this.
