## About the Book

**The Panchatantra Code** distills **26 timeless lessons** sourced from the wisdom of ancient Indian fables to help you:

1. **Stories that Teach** – Every lesson comes cloaked in a tale, because we learn better with a bit of drama and animal antics.  
2. **Ancient Wisdom, Modern Spice** – These aren’t dusty Sanskrit scrolls, but street-smart insights that fit in your meeting notes.  
3. **Soul-Friendly** – No soul-selling required. Your ethics stay intact, your climb stays legit.
