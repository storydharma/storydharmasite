# Why should you read this series?
![Siddharth.jpeg](/img/user/Siddharth.jpeg)

I used to think that working hard and being talented were enough to do well in the corporate world. I was proved wrong by DeceptiveGlow.

But who am I? My name is Siddharth*. I’m one of the leaders at DeceptiveGlow today. But when I first joined, I was a beginner with big dreams. I came from a family that taught me the importance of working hard, using my skills, and doing the right thing. When I started, I was shocked to see office politics, people doing unfair things, and coworkers talking badly behind each other’s backs. My growth stopped. I didn’t want to lower myself to play these dirty games. I couldn’t fix the system because all the power was with the wrong people. I was close to losing who I was.

Then, I found the [[Panchatantra\|Panchatantra]] through my mentor, Dr. Vishnusharma. With help from the Panchatantra and Dr. Vishnusharma, I moved up in the company and became a senior leader. Along the way, I also made sure DeceptiveGlow became one of the most honest and fair companies in the world. I call this ‘Dharmic success’.

I earned a lot of respect, got noticed, grew in my job, gained power, and became successful. This wisdom series is about what I learned from the Panchatantra and how you can use it in your work life too.

* Siddharth is a fictional persona based on real life people I ([[About the author\|About the author]]) meet and mentor every day
